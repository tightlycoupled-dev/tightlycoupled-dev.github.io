For this week's episode, Aji & Mina read chapters 5 through 7 of "Getting Started with Rails", covering autoloading, MVC and CRUD. They discuss how little effort it takes to arrive at a simple, but fully functional, Rails application, alternative strategies to the Rails console when debugging in production and much more.
